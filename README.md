Part I - Observations

For the data provided, my 3 obsevations are: The closer you get to latitude 20 (close to equador) the max tempature is the highest. It is 100% more cloudy when closer to the equator, thats where the bigger clusters are. Lastly, Northern Hempisphere, has more of a range of humidity compared to Southern, same as cloudiness and wind speed. 

Part II - Observations

Screen Shot a Picture of Heat Map - In my repo its called "Heat_Layer_Map_20210602"

This map would only stay for a couple seconds. It gives me an error but this was the best i could do.
